# Checkout Flow Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring changes made to simplify and improve the checkout flow, focusing on all four steps (1, 2, 3, and 4). The refactoring creates a more consistent, maintainable, and robust checkout experience.

## Overview of Changes

We created a centralized data fetching and management utility that all components can use. This eliminates duplicate code and standardizes how data is fetched, stored, and retrieved across the checkout flow.

## Key Improvements

1. **Centralized Data Management**
   - Created `/src/utils/dataFetcher.ts` as a unified API for data operations
   - Standardized interfaces for `CourseDetail`, `UserInfo`, and `PaymentInfo`
   - Added utility functions for all data operations

2. **Simplified Components**
   - Reduced code duplication across components
   - Removed redundant localStorage calls
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Better management of component mounting/unmounting

3. **Improved Flow**
   - Flow between steps is now more consistent
   - Cleaner integration with the FlowStepWrapper system
   - Shared validation patterns across different flow steps

## Detailed Changes

### Step 1: Course Details Component

- Moved course fetching logic to a central utility
- Standardized error handling
- Properly handles component mounting/unmounting
- Removed direct localStorage access while maintaining backward compatibility
- Implemented proper TypeScript types for data structures

### Step 2: User Information Component

- Uses the same centralized data utility
- Removed duplicate code for fetching course details
- Simplified form submission logic
- Improved loading and error states
- Ensures data is saved consistently to both flowStorage and legacy localStorage

### Step 3: Payment Selection Component

- Integrated with the centralized data fetcher utility
- Parallel data loading with Promise.all for improved performance
- Clear loading and error states with appropriate UI feedback
- Maintains compatibility with both Swish and invoice payment methods
- Corrected the flow for Swish payments to properly track payment status
- Better separation of concerns between payment methods
- Preserved the complex payment logic while improving data handling

### Step 4: Confirmation Component

- Standardized data retrieval from both flowStorage and fallback sources
- Simplified booking reference generation
- Added unified cleanup function to reset all data after checkout
- Properly handles all data types with proper TypeScript interfaces

## Migration Path

Components now prioritize using the flowStorage API while maintaining backward compatibility with direct localStorage access:

1. First try to get data from flowData props (passed by FlowStepWrapper)
2. Then try to get from flowStorage API
3. Finally fall back to legacy localStorage

This ensures a smooth transition and maintains compatibility with both old and new systems.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Code is now more DRY and follows clear patterns
- **TypeScript Support**: Better type definitions for data structures
- **Performance**: Reduced duplicate fetching of the same data
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and state management
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new features or flow types

## Next Steps

All steps in the checkout flow have now been refactored using the same patterns, creating a consistent and maintainable system. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Server-side state persistence**: Moving from client-side storage to server-side state management
2. **Authentication integration**: Adding user accounts for returning customers
3. **Enhanced analytics**: Better tracking of checkout flow progression and abandonment
4. **A/B testing framework**: Infrastructure for testing different checkout variations
5. **Localization**: Internationalization support for multiple languages
