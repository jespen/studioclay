## Performance Optimization

The shop features include performance optimizations to ensure a smooth experience for both customers and administrators.

### API Caching

The system implements a robust caching system for API calls to reduce server load and improve performance:

1. **Client-side caching**: API responses are cached in memory to avoid redundant network requests
2. **Cache expiration**: Each cached response has a configurable time-to-live
3. **Cache invalidation**: Cache is automatically invalidated when data is modified
4. **Typed helpers**: Type-safe helper functions for different data types (products, orders, etc.)

Implementation details:
- The cache system is implemented in `src/utils/apiCache.ts`
- Components use specialized helper functions like `fetchProductsWithCache` and `fetchOrdersWithCache`
- The cache is invalidated after create, update, or delete operations

### Code Optimization

The codebase follows best practices for React performance:

1. **Memoization**: Components use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Proper dependencies**: All `useEffect` hooks have correct dependency arrays
3. **Efficient state updates**: Batch state updates when possible to reduce renders
4. **Lazy loading**: Some components and resources are loaded only when needed

### Monitoring and Debugging

The system includes tools for performance monitoring:

1. **Console logs**: Critical operations log performance metrics
2. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all API operations
3. **Performance tracking**: Key operations track timing for optimization
