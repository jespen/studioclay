# Checkout Flow Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring changes made to simplify and improve the checkout flow, focusing on steps 1, 2, and 4. The payment component (step 3) is intentionally left unchanged as requested.

## Overview of Changes

We created a centralized data fetching and management utility that all components can use. This eliminates duplicate code and standardizes how data is fetched, stored, and retrieved across the checkout flow.

## Key Improvements

1. **Centralized Data Management**
   - Created `/src/utils/dataFetcher.ts` as a unified API for data operations
   - Standardized interfaces for `CourseDetail`, `UserInfo`, and `PaymentInfo`
   - Added utility functions for all data operations

2. **Simplified Components**
   - Reduced code duplication across components
   - Removed redundant localStorage calls
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Better management of component mounting/unmounting

3. **Improved Flow**
   - Flow between steps is now more consistent
   - Cleaner integration with the FlowStepWrapper system
   - Shared validation patterns across different flow steps

## Detailed Changes

### Step 1: Course Details Component

- Moved course fetching logic to a central utility
- Standardized error handling
- Properly handles component mounting/unmounting
- Removed direct localStorage access while maintaining backward compatibility
- Implemented proper TypeScript types for data structures

### Step 2: User Information Component

- Uses the same centralized data utility
- Removed duplicate code for fetching course details
- Simplified form submission logic
- Improved loading and error states
- Ensures data is saved consistently to both flowStorage and legacy localStorage

### Step 4: Confirmation Component

- Standardized data retrieval from both flowStorage and fallback sources
- Simplified booking reference generation
- Added unified cleanup function to reset all data after checkout
- Properly handles all data types with proper TypeScript interfaces

## Migration Path

Components now prioritize using the flowStorage API while maintaining backward compatibility with direct localStorage access:

1. First try to get data from flowData props (passed by FlowStepWrapper)
2. Then try to get from flowStorage API
3. Finally fall back to legacy localStorage

This ensures a smooth transition and maintains compatibility with both old and new systems.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Code is now more DRY and follows clear patterns
- **TypeScript Support**: Better type definitions for data structures
- **Performance**: Reduced duplicate fetching of the same data
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and state management
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new features or flow types

## Next Steps

The payment section (step 3) has been left unchanged for now, but in the future, it could be refactored using the same patterns to complete the modernization of the checkout flow.
